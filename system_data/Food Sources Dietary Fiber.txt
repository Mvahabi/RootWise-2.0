Dietary Fiber
Dietary fiber comes from plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, legumes,
nuts, seeds, and grains. The fiber in plant foods is not digested by enzymes
present in the digestive tract, but it may be digested by the microorganisms
that inhabit the intestines.
Dietary fiber is usually described as “soluble” or “insoluble,” based on its ability to
dissolve in water. For example, the inner portion of an apple contains soluble fiber,
whereas the peel is made of insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber contributes to a feeling
of fullness and helps maintain a healthy weight. It also decreases the absorption
of dietary sugars and fats, thereby helping to manage blood sugar and blood fat
levels. Soluble fiber also serves as a food source for the beneficial bacteria that
inhabit the digestive tract. The insoluble fiber in plant foods is helpful in moving
waste products through the digestive tract. It also provides bulk to the stool and is
beneficial in preventing constipation, hemorrhoids, and diverticuli.
