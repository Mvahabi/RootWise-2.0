What Are Fermented Foods?
Fermented foods are those changed by the desired action of microbes,
usually bacteria or yeast. A wide range of foods can be fermented, including
milk (dairy or non-dairy), vegetables, beans, grains, fruits, meats, and fish.

Fermented foods aren’t the same as probiotics, which are specific strains of
live microbes with proven health benefits, like supporting your immune system
or gut health. The microbes used to make fermented foods aren't necessarily
probiotics, though many are.
Choosing fermented foods with “live and active cultures” may benefit you
most. Some fermented foods, such as sourdough bread and shelf-stable
sauerkraut, are heat processed. That destroys live microbial cultures. Still,
fermentation itself changes foods in ways that could help you.

Regularly eating nutritious fermented foods may reduce your risk of chronic
conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, and
dementia (like Alzheimer’s). Yogurt is one of the best-studied fermented foods
linked to a lower risk of chronic disease. Yogurt is also a good low-sodium
option among fermented foods, many of which are made with salt. Generally,
it is a good idea to include a variety of fermented foods three or more days
per week as part of a health-promoting eating plan.

Fermented Food Recipes
Dr. Lipski’s Yogurt
Makes approximately 1 quart
Ingredients
• 1 quart milk
• 1 tablespoon plain yogurt with live cultures
Directions
1. Preheat a 1-quart glass jar by filling it with warm water and putting the lid on.
2. Heat the milk in a saucepan until it is 180° F. Or, heat it until you see tiny
bubbles form (but stop before it reaches the boiling point). The heat will kill
any unwanted microbes by gently pasteurizing the milk.
3. Cool the milk to lukewarm, 110° F. It should feel just barely warm if you put
your finger into it. You can speed up the process by putting the warmed milk
into the refrigerator or setting it over a bowl of cold water.
4. Once the milk is warm but not hot, empty the water from the 1-quart glass jar
and fill it with the milk. Add the plain yogurt as a starter. This can be yogurt you
bought, or it can be from the last batch of yogurt you made. Put a lid on the jar,
and shake the jar to mix thoroughly.
Tip from Dr. Lipski: Once
you have your yogurt,
add nuts, seeds, granola,
berries, or other fruit. You
can also use the yogurt in
smoothies or other recipes.
The sky is the limit!
5. Put the yogurt in a warm place, such as a small cooler filled with hot water.
Alternately, some people use a yogurt maker. Others use the pilot light in their
oven for heat or wrap the yogurt jar in a towel and put it near a radiator. Yogurt
isn’t too picky about where you put it to ferment; it just needs to stay warm
(about 110° F).
6. Once you find a warm spot for the yogurt, leave it alone for 8 to 12 hours.
Afterward, it will be a bit sour and should have thickened. If it hasn’t thickened,
make sure it’s warm and leave it for a few more hours.
7. Like store-bought yogurt, keep this homemade yogurt in your refrigerator for
up to a few weeks.

Fermented Food Recipes
Dr. Wahls’ Sauerkraut
Makes approximately 2 quarts
Ingredients*
• 1 medium head cabbage (red or green)
• 1 tablespoon sea salt (use 2 tablespoons if you don’t have a starter)
• ½ cup to 1 cup of starter sauerkraut
• 1 teaspoon to 2 tablespoons spices, such as ginger, garlic, caraway, or
turmeric (optional)
• Other chopped vegetables, such as carrots, beets, or radishes (optional)
*If possible, use organic vegetables to minimize pesticide residues.
Directions
1. Save the outer two leaves of the cabbage to act as covers for the sauerkraut (see
Step 4). Grate the cabbage, such as with a food processor or a large hand grater.
2. Mix the grated cabbage, salt, and starter together in a non-metal bowl and
massage the cabbage to express its juice. Use a wooden press if needed to
express more juice.
Tip from Dr. Wahls: If
sauerkraut is new to your
family, begin with a small
forkful stirred into a soup,
skillet meal, or vegetable
dish. Add the sauerkraut
just before serving so the
health-promoting bacteria
are not killed by cooking.
Sauerkraut also makes a
terrific addition to salads.
Simply add olive oil, and
the salad is dressed.
3. Pack the sauerkraut into a 2-quart jar. (If there is extra, put the rest in a smaller
jar.) You can use a wooden press to push and compress the cabbage into the jar
and eliminate air pockets. The goal is to have the cabbage underneath the juice.
If the juice is insufficient to cover the grated cabbage, take it back out of the jar
and place it in the bowl. Let it sit for another 30 minutes and pack again.
4. Cover the top of the cabbage with a cabbage leaf. Place a weight on top of the
cabbage leaf to keep the cabbage below the vegetable juice line. There are a
variety of devices that are available to help keep the vegetables below the juice
line and keep oxygen out, which will eliminate the need for the cabbage leaf.
5. Place the jar on a plate or in a bowl to catch any overflow liquid if the juice rises
over the top of the jar as it ferments.
6. Place a towel over the sauerkraut, which prefers to ferment in the dark.
7. Check the sauerkraut in 3 to 5 days for taste and texture. Does it have the
amount of “tang” that you desire? Note that the longer it ferments, the softer
the cabbage will become.
8. After fermenting, repack sauerkraut into 1-pint or 1-quart jars and refrigerate.

Fermented Food Recipes
Dr. Lukaczer’s Kimchi
Makes approximately 2 quarts
Ingredients*
• 1 head napa cabbage
• 1 to 2 tablespoons sea salt
• 10 medium garlic cloves, sliced
• ½ large yellow or red onion, thinly sliced
• 1 daikon radish, sliced into 2-inch strips
• 4-inch ginger root, diced
• 2 tablespoons red pepper flakes (adjust the amount based on how spicy
you want it)
• 1 to 2 tablespoons Korean red pepper powder
• 3 bunches scallions, chopped
• 1 serrano chili pepper, diced
*If possible, use organic vegetables to minimize pesticide residues.
Directions
1. Cut the cabbage into approximately 2-inch pieces. Place them in a large bowl,
sprinkle with the sea salt, toss, and add enough cold (filtered) water to cover
the cabbage. Place BPA-free plastic wrap or a plate over the top and let the
cabbage marinate in the salt water for 6 to 12 hours.
2. In a separate larger bowl, combine the garlic, onion, daikon radish, ginger, red
pepper flakes, Korean red pepper powder, scallions, and serrano chili pepper.
How is kimchi used? This
spicy, traditional Korean dish
may be eaten by itself or as
an ingredient in other recipes.
It is also used as a condiment
to flavor dishes like stir-fries,
rice, and noodles.

3. Drain and rinse the salted cabbage, then add it to the larger bowl. Toss the
ingredients with your hands (wear food-grade gloves) until everything is
combined and the cabbage is thoroughly coated with the mixture.
4. Pack cabbage into jars (such as two 1-quart glass jars with a screw-top lid). The
liquid should cover the cabbage. You can put a small shot glass on top of the
cabbage to pack it down, which brings up the liquid. Loosely screw on the lids.
5. Let the jars sit in a cool, dark place for 96 hours (four full days). Then open the
jars to let the gases escape. (Be careful if you’ve packed the jars to the top, as
they will off-gas and bubble; you’ve created a living “creature.”) Taste. If it’s not
spicy enough, reseal and let it marinate a little longer. Refrigerate to store.
