What Is Functional
Nutrition?
Functional nutrition emphasizes the importance ofhigh-qualityfoods and
phytonutrient diversity to address clinical imbalances and move individuals
toward the highest expression ofhealth. Advanced nutrition assessment
and a thorough functional medicine-based history lead to apersonalized
therapeutic intervention created topromote optimal health andprevent diet-
and lifestyle-related disease.

Nutrition is the core modality of functional medicine, an integrative approach
to health. As defined by The Institute for Functional Medicine:
“Functional medicine is an evolution in the practice of medicine that better
addresses the healthcare needs of the 21st century. By shifting the traditional
disease-centered focus of medical practice to a more patient-centered
approach, functional medicine addresses the whole person, not just an
isolated set of symptoms. Functional medicine practitioners spend time with
their patients, listening to their histories and evaluating the interactions
among genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-
term health and complex, chronic disease. In this way, functional medicine
supports the unique expression of health and vitality for each individual.”

WhyDo WeNeed Functional Nutrition?
¢ The prevalence of complex, chronic diseases is escalating globally, from
heart disease and diabetes to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic
fatigue, fibromyalgia, mental illness, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other
autoimmune disorders.
Why Do We Need Functional Nutrition?
• The prevalence of complex, chronic diseases is escalating globally, from
heart disease and diabetes to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic
fatigue, fibromyalgia, mental illness, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other
autoimmune disorders.
¢ Chronic diseases are diet- and lifestyle-related conditions and require
dietary and lifestyle solutions. A major strength of functional nutrition is
its focus on the molecular mechanisms that underlie disease, providing the
basis for targeted, innovative solutions that can restore health.
¢ The current healthcare system fails to take into account the unique
genetic makeup of each individual or the ability of food, toxins, and
other environmental factors to influence gene expression. The interaction
between genes and environmental factors is a critical component in the
development of chronic disease and plays a central role in the functional
nutrition approach.

• Most nutrition professionals are not adequately trained in integrating
nutrition assessment at the molecular and cellular levels with emerging
research in nutrition and nutritional genomics. These advanced practice skills
are essential for preventing and managing today’s chronic disorders.
What Distinguishes a Functional Nutrition Practitioner?
IFM’s Functional Nutrition Evaluation offers an ABCD organizational
approach to support clinical analysis, and it allows for nutrition-related
findings and clinical patterns to emerge. From the medical history, physical
and laboratory exams, and a diet and lifestyle review, the functional nutrition
assessment improves the identification of insufficiencies or imbalances
through the PFC-MVP model. This acronym represents Protein, Fat/Oils,
Carbohydrates, Minerals, Vitamins, and Phytonutrients.
Here’s an overview of the ABCD organizational approach:
• A - Anthropometrics help to identify altered body composition patterns and
abnormal vital signs.
• B - Biomarkers and functional laboratory findings uncover PFC-MVP
nutrition insufficiencies and physiologic patterns linked to clinical
imbalances.
• C - Clinical Indicators from the physical exam identify signs related to
nutrition abnormalities that can be further explored through laboratory and
functional assessments.
• D - Diet, Nutrition, and Lifestyle Journals from IFM explore daily or weekly
food intake, PFC-MVP assessment, patterns of eating, cravings and habitual
foods, and stress eating associations.
