Understanding food labels makes it easier to stay on track with your
health and nutrition goals, but the information found on food labels can be
confusing. This handout walks you through how to read food labels along
with general recommendations.

* The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how mucha nutrient in
a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories
a day is used for general nutrition advice.
The first section of a food label contains information about the amount of
food in the package. Labels indicate two things: the number of servings in
the entire package, and the average serving size. Serving sizes are shown in
two measurements: standard (cups) and metric (grams). In this example, the
package contains 8 servings of food. One serving is equal to 2/3 cup, or 55
grams.

This section contains information about the number of calories in one serving
of this food. Calories are units of energy generated by the food. In this label
example, the entire package of food contains 1,840 calories (230 calories
multiplied by 8 servings).

Under Total Fat, two sections are listed:
Saturated Fat: For heart health, limit saturated fats to 7-10% of your total
daily calories, which is about 12-15 grams of saturated fat per day.
Under Total Fat, two sections are listed:
Saturated Fat: For heart health, limit saturated fats to 7-10% of your total
daily calories, which is about 12-15 grams of saturated fat per day.
Trans Fat: Because of their negative effect on heart health, avoid trans fats.
A food label can list the trans fat content as zero if amount contained in one
serving is less than 0.5 grams. To be sure a food is free of trans fat, look at the
ingredient list. Trans fats are often listed as"partially-hydrogenated” fats or
oils.

Under Total Carbohydrate, three sections are listed:
Dietary Fiber: Fiber is a healthy carbohydrate that isn’t absorbed by the body.
Aim to eat at least 25 grams fiber each day for women or 38 grams for men.
Total Sugars: This includes both naturally occurring and added sugars.
Added Sugars: This is the amount of sugar the food manufacturer has added
to the food. Limit added sugars to no more than 24 grams per day for women
or 35 grams per day for men.

Select vitamins and minerals are also listed. For all nutrients, the Percent Daily
Value (DV) is shown on the right side of the label. DVs are an percentage of how
much that nutrient contributes to a day’s worth of food. All DVs are based on
a diet of 2,000 calories per day, however individual calorie needs vary. You may
require more or less calories than this amount.
Decoding Ingredient Lists
In the ingredients list of a food label, ingredients are listed in order of largest to
smallest amounts. This means that the ingredient that weighs the most is listed
first, and the ingredients that weigh the least are listed last.
The ingredient list is particularly important if you have food allergies or
sensitivities, as many packaged foods can have hidden sources of common
allergens. The eight most common food allergens include eggs, milk, peanuts,
tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat (gluten), and soy. These ingredients, and any
ingredients derived from them, are required by U.S. law to be listed on all food
labels. While they will be listed in the ingredients, they may also appear in a
statement immediately after the list (e.g., “Contains wheat, milk, and soy”).
Allergen-free packaged foods may still contain trace amounts if they are made
on shared equipment. Some manufacturers include advisory statements on their
products if they are made in a facility that also processes a major food allergen
(e.g., “Packaged in a plant that also processes wheat”). Read the ingredient
list thoroughly to prevent an accidental adverse food reaction. The list below
provides examples of how these foods might be listed in ingredient lists.
Eggs: albumin (or albumen), egg (dried, powdered, solids, white, yolk), eggnog,
lysozyme, mayonnaise, meringue (meringue powder), ovalbumin, surimi
Fish: fish meal, fish oil, fish sauce, surimi, specific species of fish (e.g., bass,
cod, flounder, etc.)
Milk: buttermilk solids, casein, caseinate, galactose, hydrolysate, lactate,
lactose, milk (dried, malted, powdered, solids, etc.), quark, rennet, whey
Peanuts: arachic oil, beer nuts, cold-pressed, extruded or expelled peanut
oil, earth nuts, hydrolyzed peanut protein, mixed nuts, Nu nuts, nut pieces,
nutmeat, peanut (butter, flour, paste, sauce, etc.)
Shellfish: barnacle, fish stock, seafood flavoring, surimi, specific type of
crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, crawfish, krill, lobster, prawns, or shrimp)
Soy: bean curd, edamame, hydrolyzed soy protein, kinako, miso, natto, okara,
soy (albumin, concentrate, fiber, grits, milk, miso, nuts, sauce, flour, etc.),
soybeans, soy lecithin, tamari, tempeh, textured vegetable protein, tofu
Tree Nuts: artificial flavoring, nut butters, nut meal, nutmeat, nut oil, nut pieces,
any ingredient made with a specific type of tree nut (e.g., almond, cashew,
pecan, walnut, etc.)

Wheat (gluten): dextrin, maltodextrin, modified food starch, textured
vegetable protein, specific strains of wheat (e.g., durum wheat, club wheat,
spelt, semolina, Einkorn, emmer, kamut, and triticale. Note that “wheat-free”
does not mean “gluten-free,” as “wheat-free” products may contain barley,
rye, or oats. If you are sensitive to gluten, be sure to avoid products containing
barley, rye, and oats.
What About Sugar?
Some packaged foods that are made almost entirely of sugar may not list the
first ingredient as sugar, which can be misleading. In some cases, many different
types of sugar are included in one product. Each of those types of sugar is
listed separately according to its weight, but when added together, they could
make up the majority of the food product. This is why it is important to check
food labels for the total amount of sugar per serving.
