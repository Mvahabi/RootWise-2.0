We’re entering a time when groceries are going to cost even more—thanks to upcoming tariffs, supply chain stress, and, frankly, policy decisions that a lot of us saw coming.

What Is Zero Waste Cooking?
Zero waste cooking means using every part of your ingredients to reduce food waste, save money on groceries, and get more from what you already have. It’s a practical approach that’s budget-friendly, offers plant-based zero waste, and rooted in everyday creativity. By integrating zero-waste cooking practices into your life, you’re stretching your budget and making the most of what’s already in your kitchen.

What Zero-Waste Cooking Actually Means (and Why It Matters)
Zero-waste cooking isn’t about perfection or pressure—it’s about using what you’ve got, wasting less, and making your kitchen work smarter. At its core, it’s a mindset shift: instead of tossing scraps, aging produce, or nearly-empty jars, you pause and ask, can this still be useful? Most of the time, the answer is yes.

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

Use every part of your ingredients—stems, peels, cores, and all.
Store food properly—so it lasts longer and doesn’t surprise you with fuzz.
Turn leftovers into something new—instead of letting them sit and spoil.
Compost what can’t be used—to keep scraps out of landfills and enrich the soil.
Reduce packaging waste—by buying in bulk, reusing jars, and skipping single-use plastics.
Get creative with odds and ends—instead of starting fresh every night.
This isn’t about doing everything at once. It’s about small choices—freezing instead of forgetting, cooking just enough, or grabbing the soft celery instead of ignoring it again. These habits might not look flashy, but they add up. Over time, zero-waste cooking helps you save money, reduce clutter, and feel more grounded in the kitchen.

Zero Waste Cooking Setup: Tips For Getting Started
Getting your kitchen ready for zero-waste cooking is simpler than you think. It’s all about small changes that make a big difference, like keeping track of what you already have and using it up before it goes to waste. These easy steps will help you stretch your budget, save money on groceries, and feel more in control when it comes to meal planning. Ready for plant-based zero waste success? Here are some tips to keep in mind:

Keep a pantry inventory list: A running list of what you already have makes meal planning easier and prevents repeat buys.
Label leftovers and dry goods with dates: Knowing when something went into the fridge—or when you opened that oat milk—helps you use it before it goes bad.
Start a “use-it-up” bin in the fridge: A designated space for almost-gone ingredients keeps aging produce visible and more likely to get eaten.
Label and rotate frozen items: Use masking tape or a grease pencil to mark freezer dates, and place older containers in a “use first” zone to avoid waste.
Buy pantry staples in bulk (when you can): Beans, lentils, pasta, rice, oats, and flour are inexpensive, versatile, and long-lasting. Stock up when prices are low. Find some great resources and ideas in our bulk-buying guide!
Store dry goods in clear jars or containers: This simple swap helps you spot what’s running low and keeps pantry staples fresh longer.
Cook a weekly batch of rice or beans: It’s simple, cheap, and gives you a flexible base for nearly any meal. Add veggies, sauce, or a leftover and you’ve got dinner.
Cook once, eat twice: Double your soups, stews, or grains and stash half in the freezer. You’ll have a ready-made meal using zero waste cooking methods when time is tight.
Save veggie scraps for broth: Onion skins, carrot ends, garlic peels, herb stems—toss them in a freezer bag and make a rich, homemade stock when it’s full. This is an OG zero waste cooking tip!
Freeze kitchen scraps for compost: If you don’t have time to compost right away, stash food scraps in a sealed container in the freezer. No smell, no waste.
Plan one “buy nothing new” dinner each week: Choose one night to skip the grocery store and build a meal entirely from what’s already in your kitchen.
Practice “first in, first out” (FIFO): Rotate older items to the front of the fridge or pantry so they’re used up before the newer stuff.
Think of this as your prep station for what’s ahead—a simple, effective setup for sustainable cooking habits.

Small Reset, Big Impact: When It All Feels Like Too Much
Some days, zero-waste cooking is probably the last thing on your mind. The fridge is full but nothing feels easy. You’re tired. Groceries cost too much. Everything is… kind of a lot. That’s okay.

This section isn’t a to-do list. It’s a soft landing—a few quiet reminders for when you’re running on low and just need to get through the next meal (or moment). These ideas aren’t revolutionary. But they’re kind. And sometimes that’s more than enough.

Reheat that soup you froze three weeks ago. That was future-you looking out for you. Let it help.
Toast some bread, add olive oil, lemon, salt, and call it dinner. It counts.
Eat something comforting. Leftover pasta, freezer dumplings, half a bag of tater tots. You’re still feeding yourself.
Share what you can. Offer a neighbor the extra soup you made. Text a friend your favorite easy meal. Tiny things feel big right now.
Choose one thing to restock, not everything. Oats. Frozen spinach. Lemon. That one zero waste cooking thing that makes meals feel possible again.
Let the dishes sit until tomorrow if you need to. The world won’t end, and you deserve rest.
Say something kind to yourself while you stir the pot or chop the onion. You’re doing a good job—even if it’s messy, late, or pieced together from scraps.
The truth is, being gentle with yourself is a form of resilience. Especially when the systems around us aren’t.

These vegan hacks aren’t about perfection. If you’re tired, maxed out, or just trying to figure out how to save money on groceries without sacrificing comfort, these are reminders of how to empower yourself.

They’re about choosing what works for you and letting the rest go. It’s being gentle with yourself when energy is low, helping your neighbor when you can, and remembering that every small action counts—especially when it comes from a place of care.

Zero waste cooking is quiet, steady, and resilient. Use what’s useful. Share what helps. Come back to this when you need a reset—not a total overhaul, just a reminder that zero-waste cooking, plant-based meals, and budget-friendly habits aren’t just about sustainability. They’re about making life feel a little more doable right now.

About Olives for Dinner and Erin and Jeff Wysocarski in their kitchen.
Hi, I'm Erin
Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I whip up delicious vegan dishes that feature vegan seafood, comfort food classics, and rich, umami flavors. You'll discover fresh and creative recipes here—all made with plants!

Our work has been featured in VegNews, HuffPost, Bon Appétit, and more.

My husband, Jeff, loves to capture all the photos you see here. We call Boston home, sharing our space with our adorable rescue pup, Harper.
