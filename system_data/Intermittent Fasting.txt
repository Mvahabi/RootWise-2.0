Intermittent Fasting
Intermittent Fasting
Intermittent fasting (IF) is a broad term that means cycling between periods
of restricting calories and periods of not restricting calories. While fasting,
you may either avoid all foods and beverages with calories or greatly limit
your calorie intake. The time period of complete fasting or significant calorie
restriction is generally between 12 to 48 hours.

Types of Intermittent Fasting
There are many types of intermittent fasting. Some of the more common
approaches are defined here:
¢ Time-restricted eating (TRE) means you only eat during a set window of
time, which may range anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. This is also called
prolonged nightly fasting and extends a person’s typical overnight fast.
For example, you might only eat between 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., which is often
called a 16:8 plan. This means 16 hours of fasting and an 8-hour eating
window. The length of the eating window and where it is placed during
the day can vary. The amount of food or calories and the number of meals
you can have during the eating window are generally not restricted.

• Alternate-day fasting (ADF), also called fasting intervals, means a cycle
of fasting on one day and then normal food intake the next day. You only
consume water and electrolytes on fasting days. Alternate-day fasting can
also mean fasting every third day or on a more personalized schedule that
works for you.

Intermittent energy restriction (IER) or modified fasting means switching
between days of eating a very low-calorie diet and normal calorie intake.
The days you restrict calories may either be in a row or split up during the
week. Two examples of this type of fasting are:

The days you restrict calories may either be in a row or split up during the
week. Two examples of this type of fasting are:
• Modified alternate-day fasting. This is like alternate-day fasting,
except you can eat up to 600 calories or 25% of your daily calorie
needs on the days you fast. For example, if you need 2,000 calories
daily to maintain your weight, you’d only eat 500 calories (25% of your
needs) on days of fasting.

e 5:2 method. This means that on two days of the week, you have a very
low-calorie intake (no more than 25% of your daily calorie needs). On
the other five days, you have a normal calorie intake.

Who Benefits from Intermittent Fasting?
Work with your healthcare practitioner to find out if fasting is right for you
and the best type of fasting for your needs. Studies suggest fasting may
improve insulin resistance, blood sugar, blood pressure, inflammation, short-
term weight loss, and brain health. Longer-term studies are needed to confirm
fasting helps weight control and other aspects of health over time.
Fasting may improve:
• Blood pressure
• Antioxidant activity
• Insulin effectiveness
• Brain function
Fasting may decrease:
• Blood sugar
• Free radicals (damaging
molecules)
• Inflammation
• Triglycerides
Who Should Not Fast or Should Fast With Extra Caution?
Fasting is not advised for children or if you are frail, underweight, pregnant,
trying to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. Individuals with an eating
disorder or disordered eating pattern should not fast. Those with an irregular
heartbeat, low blood pressure, or extreme fatigue should also avoid fasting.
In general, if you have a health condition, you should first discuss the
risks versus the potential benefits of fasting with your functional medicine
practitioner. Special caution is needed if you have diabetes, metabolic
syndrome, or symptoms related to unbalanced blood sugar. You would need
to work with a healthcare practitioner with expertise in fasting and adjusting
medications to account for changes in your eating and body weight.
General Advice for Intermittent Fasting
• Drink plenty of filtered water on fasting days. Your functional medicine
practitioner may also recommend electrolytes or other supplements
personalized for you.
• Avoid high-intensity exercise while fasting. Walking, yoga, or other light-to-
moderate intensity activity are OK.
• Be aware of your movement and balance. You may feel dizzy or lightheaded,
especially when first starting a fast.
• Eat mostly whole, unprocessed, nutrient-rich foods since you won’t be
eating much on fasting days.
• Stop fasting if you feel unwell and call your functional medicine provider.

Sample 600-Calorie Food Plan (for Fasting Days)
For nutrient-rich recipes,
please see IFM’s Mito Food
Plan - Weekly Planner and
Recipes. You could use
the lower-calorie recipes in
600-calorie food plans on
fasting days. You can enjoy
the other recipes during
non-fasting times.
• Breakfast: One scrambled egg with a cup of spinach sautéed in a small
amount of chicken broth. Top with a fourth of a fresh avocado and a pinch
of sea salt and pepper.
• Lunch: 2 or 3 ounces of cooked turkey or chicken served on 2 cups of mixed
baby greens. Drizzle with the juice of half a lemon and 1 teaspoon olive oil.
Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt and cracked pepper.
• Dinner: 2 or 3 ounces poached or broiled salmon and a cup of steamed
broccoli drizzled with ½ teaspoon olive oil and the juice of half a lemon or
lime. Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt and fresh herbs of choice.
