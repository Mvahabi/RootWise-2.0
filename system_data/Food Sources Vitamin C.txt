production.1Vitamin C is also an important antioxidant and participates in
many chemical reactions in the body.2
Fruits and vegetables contain the most vitamin C of all food sources. Some
fortified foods may also contain vitamin C, as well as, supplements. Since vitamin
C is heat sensitive, eating fruits and vegetables either raw, or lightly steamed is
recommended. Vitamin C deficiency is rare as long as fruits and vegetables are
included in the diet. Individuals who smoke or eat few fruits and vegetables may be
at an increased risk for vitamin C insufficiency.
