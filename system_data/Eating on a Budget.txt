¢ Consult the Environmental Working Group’s Clean 15™ and Dirty Dozen™
lists. Use these lists to prioritize which foods you will buy organic vs.
conventional. Clean 15 foods have little pesticide residue when raised
conventionally and are safe to consume. Dirty Dozen foods have the most
pesticide residue when raised conventionally, so they should be purchased
organic when possible.

In the Store

• Avoid packaged and processed foods when possible. Premium packaging
often contributes to the higher cost of these items.
• Buy fruits and vegetables while they are in season. Seasonal produce is
usually more flavorful and less expensive. In-season produce is often priced
to sell before it goes bad.
• Buy frozen produce as an alternative to fresh. Produce is frozen at the
height of freshness, and most of the nutrient content remains intact. When
possible, stock up on frozen produce and save it for when money is tighter.
• Buy in bulk. Spices and dry goods (rice, beans, grains, nuts, flours, etc.) are
significantly cheaper in the bulk section. You can buy as much or as little as
you need, depending on your storage space and budget.
• Skip the interior aisles stocked with chips, snacks, candy, and soda. Instead,
do most of your shopping on the perimeter of the store, where produce,
meats, and dairy products are located.
• Only buy foods that are on your grocery list.
• Buy generic or store brand items when possible.
