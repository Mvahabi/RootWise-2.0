Essential Fatty Acids
Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) cannot be created by your body. They are called
“essential” because you must get them through your diet. There are two
primary families of essential fatty acids: omega-6 and omega-3.

Linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) are two common omega-é fatty acids.
LA is found in most plant oils, and AA is present in meat, poultry, and eggs. Alpha-
linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
are the most common omegza-3 fatty acids. Some plant foods contain ALA, while
fatty fish are the best source of EPA and DHA.

Every cell in the body needs EFAs for proper structure and function. EFAs promote
healthy nerve functioning and play a role in inflammation. In general, omega-6 fats
tend to promote inflammation, and omega-3 fats are anti-inflammatory.
