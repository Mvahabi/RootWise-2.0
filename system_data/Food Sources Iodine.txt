Iodine is a trace element requiredfor the body, particularly for the
production ofthyroid hormones. Because the iodine content offarming soil
varies considerably, it is difficult to determine theprecise iodine content of
foods.
Iodine is a trace element required for the body, particularly for the
production of thyroid hormones. Because the iodine content of farming soil
varies considerably, it is difficult to determine the precise iodine content of
foods.
The highest iodine concentration occurs in the soil of coastal areas. Because
of this, seaweed and seafood are the highest natural sources of this important
micronutrient. Dairy products are a good dietary source of iodine because of
iodine-containing disinfectants used on milking equipment.

It is important to have a healthy level of iodine in your body, as there are health
risks associated with having too little or too much iodine in the body. If a person
has too little iodine, thyroid hormone production is reduced. This can result in
goiters, hypothyroidism, and development problems in infants and children. Excess
iodine can cause the same problems as too little iodine, as well as hyperthyroidism
or thyroiditis.

Talk to your functional medicine practitioner before starting an iodine-containing
supplement, as it may be too much and can interfere with certain medications.

*The iodine content of seaweed greatly varies depending on the type and location where it was harvested.
In general, nori tends to be lower in iodine while kombu tends to be the highest in iodine.
