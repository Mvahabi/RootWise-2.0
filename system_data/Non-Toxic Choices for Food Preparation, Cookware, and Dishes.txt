We often think about the quality ofthefoods wepurchase andprepare to
ensure good nutrition. It’s also important to consider theproducts we use
to cook, bake, eat, and store food, as these can also potentially place our
health at risk. Certain types ofkitchenware can discharge toxicfumes,
chemicals, or other toxic components into ourfood. Over time, these toxins
can accumulate in our bodies andpotentially damage our health.

Cutting Boards
Plastic cutting boards may contain toxins such as bisphenol A (BPA) or
phthalates, which are known to be hormone-disrupting and carcinogens
(cancer-causing chemicals). Small bits of plastic containing these chemicals can
also intermingle with foods as the surfaces sustain small nicks and cuts. Plastic
cutting boards also have a greater tendency to accumulate bacteria in their
knife-scarred surfaces than wooden ones.
Best choices: Bamboo and wood. Always wash your wood or bamboo cutting
boards with hot, soapy water and allow to air dry.

Cookware
Cookware
The most popular brands of cookware used today are nonstick. Unfortunately,
Teflon® and other nonstick coatings contain chemicals that can cause cancer
and other health problems. Heating these pots and pans can release toxic
fumes, and some chemicals may also leach directly into your food.

Best choices: Food-grade stainless steel, cast iron, copper, porcelain-
enameled cast iron, oven-safe glass, stainless-steel-lined copper, and high-
quality, nontoxic ceramic-lined cookware. Also, look for cookware labeled as
free of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) and PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid).

Dishes
Plastics, including melamine dishes, may contain a variety of chemicals that
have been linked to cancer and other health problems. Acidic foods and
beverages can increase the leaching of chemicals into plastic dishware. In

addition, heating and serving hot foods on plastic and melamine dishes can
increase your exposure to chemical compounds. Plastic and melamine dishes
are often used for children, a population that is particularly vulnerable to
chemical exposures.
Best choices: Ceramic, porcelain, glass, wood, bamboo, type 304 stainless
steel, and 100% food-grade silicone (this does not have plastic fillers).
