ViVitamin B12
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble nutrient required to make healthy red
blood cells, support brain health, make DNA, metabolize homocysteine,
andprevent pernicious anemia.1 Vitamin B12 typically comes from animal
sources ofprotein (fish, meat, poultry, eggs), fortified foods (cereals, nut
“milks”), and supplements, but is notfound infruits orvegetables.

and prevent pernicious anemia.¹ Vitamin B12 typically comes from animal
sources of protein (fish, meat, poultry, eggs), fortified foods (cereals, nut
“milks”), and supplements, but is not found in fruits or vegetables.
There are several forms of vitamin B12 including cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin,
deoxyadenosylcobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin. Those who have high
homocysteine levels or genetic variants in methylation genes may respond better
to “active” forms of vitamin B12 such as methylcobalamin.?

Strict vegetarians and vegans are at higher risk for vitamin B12 deficiency because
of the avoidance of animal foods. Those with celiac disease, Crohn's disease, low
stomach acid, and the elderly may also be at higher risk for vitamin B12 deficiency
because of poor absorption.’ Certain medications (proton pump inhibitors, H2
receptor antagonists, Metformin) may also increase the likelihood of vitamin B12
deficiency.'
