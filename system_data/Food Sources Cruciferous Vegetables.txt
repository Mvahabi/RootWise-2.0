Cruciferous vegetables contain phytochemicals called isothiocyanates.
These powerful phytochemicals are thought to reduce the risk of cancer by
enhancing the body’s ability to detoxify.
Cruciferous vegetables are also important sources of protein, fiber, vitamins,
and minerals. In fact, a cup of cruciferous vegetables provides about 3 grams
of protein. For comparison, that’s the same amount of protein found in half
an ounce of chicken breast. Additionally, the fiber content of cruciferous
vegetables can aid digestion and support healthy bacteria in the gut.
Cruciferous vegetables are also good sources of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin
K, and manganese.

Eating a serving of cruciferous vegetables daily can help lower the risk of
cancer and other chronic diseases. To retain the full array of nutrients, it is
best to eat these vegetables either raw, blanched, or lightly sautéed.
