Vitamin B6 is involved in protein metabolism, immune function, neurotransmitter
production, blood sugar production, and formation of healthy red blood cells.1
It also helps regulate homocysteine, an amino acid that in high amounts can
contribute to heart and other diseases.¹ Vitamin B6 is found in a wide variety of
foods. The richest sources of vitamin B6 include fish, organ meats, potatoes, and
starchy vegetables.² Because plant foods contain a form of vitamin B6 which is less
available to the body, strict vegans many need to eat fortified foods or discuss
supplementation with their functional medicine practitioner.1
