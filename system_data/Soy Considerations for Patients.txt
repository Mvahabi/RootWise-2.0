Soy Considerations
(for Patients)
Soybeans are one ofthefewplant protein sources in our diet that contain
all essential amino acids required to make a complete protein. Soy is high in
protein, healthyfats, and dietary fiber, while being lower in carbohydrates
and saturatedfat. A % cup offirm tofu provides 14 grams ofprotein, 2.2
grams ofcarbohydrates, and 1.9 grams offiber. Soy is also rich in vitamins
and minerals, includingB vitamins, magnesium, calcium, andpotassium.2
Soybeans are one of the few plant protein sources in our diet that contain
all essential amino acids required to make a complete protein. Soy is high in
protein, healthy fats, and dietary fiber, while being lower in carbohydrates
and saturated fat.1 A ¼ cup of firm tofu provides 14 grams of protein, 2.2
grams of carbohydrates, and 1.9 grams of fiber. Soy is also rich in vitamins
and minerals, including B vitamins, magnesium, calcium, and potassium.2
Soy can support health throughout the body with notable benefits to heart
health, women’s health, men’s health, brain health, and cancer risk.*'5 The
long list of benefits has established soy as a powerhouse food.

Soy is available in two main forms: foods and supplements. Common food
sources include edamame (immature, green soybeans), tofu, soy milk, soy
flour, tempeh, miso, and soy sauce. Supplements generally contain isolated
soy proteins and soy-derived phytonutrients, mainly isoflavones.'

Heart Health
Soy is well-known for supporting heart health. A %-cup serving of firm tofu
supplies 7 grams of heart-healthy fat. Studies have shown that replacing
animal proteins with soy protein helps lower cholesterol.” In addition, diets
that include soy protein may reduce blood pressure.*

Women’s Health
Women’s Health
Soy can be beneficial for women throughout their lifespan. Women who eat
tofu have a lower risk of heart disease.5 Dietary soy and soy supplements
(isoflavones and S-equol) may help reduce the severity of menopausal hot
flashes.” Soy isoflavones may be beneficial for bone health by preventing bone
loss, especially in the spine.’

Men’s Health
Dietary soy and soy isoflavones have been shown to reduce the risk of
prostate cancer.'° Contrary to some earlier claims, recent studies indicate that
soy consumption does not have a negative impact on testosterone in men."

Brain Health
Healthy aging and brain health are other areas where soy may provide
benefits. Soy isoflavones, as well as S-equol, may help with cognitive function
and should be considered part of the dietary interventions for cognitive
decline and dementia.12,13 Soy’s positive influence on cardiovascular health
also supports cognitive health since heart disease and the risk of dementia,
including Alzheimer’s disease, are closely connected.
Cancer
Soy foods or soy isoflavones may reduce the risk of breast and colorectal
cancers, as well as the reoccurrence of breast cancer.1,10,14 Regularly eating
soy isoflavones and soy products has been associated with reduced risk of
endometrial and bladder cancer.1,10,14 Soy isoflavones may help increase the
efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation, especially in prostate cancer, as well
as protect normal cells from some of the negative effects of radiation and
anti-cancer drugs.14
Special Considerations: Soy Tolerance & Safety
Food sensitivities and allergies to soy are common. Due to soy being a
common allergen, foods containing soy must have an allergen warning on the
product label.
Soy foods may also cause digestive upset (constipation, diarrhea, nausea,
bloating) in those who are sensitive. Soy products are typically removed
during an elimination diet. Some people sensitive to soy may tolerate
fermented soy foods like miso or tempeh.
Tip: Choose organic soy
products to avoid exposure
to genetically-modified soy
treated with glyphosate.
Most conventional soy on the market is genetically modified for use with the
herbicide glyphosate. Genetically modified soy and soy products contain high
residues of glyphosate and should be minimized in your diet. Organic soy
products cannot be genetically modified or treated with glyphosate.
Special Considerations: Soy & Health Conditions
Those with breast cancer may want to avoid isoflavone supplements and
limit soy foods to 3 servings per day.15 Consuming soy in amounts greater
than what is commonly found in foods during pregnancy may be unsafe
for the baby. It is also unknown if consuming greater amounts of soy or soy
isoflavones while breastfeeding is safe for infants.
High soy intake may alter thyroid function in high-risk groups. Those with
iodine insufficiency or deficiency (especially during pregnancy) or those with
hypothyroidism may want to avoid isoflavone supplements and limit dietary
intake of soy foods to 3 servings per day.15 Ensuring adequate iodine levels
will reduce adverse effects from soy intake in most cases.

Getting Soy in Your Diet
• Add tofu in place of protein powder to your morning smoothie.
• Enjoy steamed or roasted edamame as a snack.
• Make chocolate pudding using dark chocolate and silken tofu.
• Use tempeh in place of meat (tempeh chili, barbecue tempeh, tempeh
tacos).
• Make a glaze for tofu or fish with miso, honey, and sesame oil.
• Make tofu “cheese” by coating a block of tofu with miso and refrigerate for
two days. Scrape off the miso and use the “cheese” as a dairy substitute.
You can reuse the miso in soups and other recipes.
• Use organic, unsweetened soy milk in place of dairy milk.
• Make edamame hummus using cooked, frozen edamame, tahini, lemon,
garlic, and other seasonings to taste.
