Mindful and
Intuitive Eating
Mindful and intuitive eating can help improve your relationship with
food and your body. Mindful and intuitive eating practices are helpful for
everyone, but they are especially important for those who have suffered
from eating disorders, or who feel like food controls their life. They provide
a respectful and healthy way to reconnect with food while gaining a deeper
understanding of your mind and body.

Mindful eating is the process of paying attention to your eating without
judgement. This sounds simple and straightforward, but it can be hard,
especially for those who are not used to it. A mindful eating practice helps
you become aware of the reasons behind your hunger (emotions, lack of food,
tradition, boredom, schedule, etc.).

Intuitive eating is a broader concept that includes mindful eating. It
emphasizes the connection and strengthens the relationship between mind,
body, and food. This approach allows you to eat without judgement and
respects your body regardless of how you feel about its shape. Intuitive eating

¢ Giving oneself unconditional permission to eat
Mindful and intuitive eating practices are not diets. They are mindsets that
require you to trust your instincts and listen to your body’s natural hunger and
fullness cues. In these practices, there is no directive to eat or not eat specific
amounts of food at specific times. Instead, these practices teach you to listen
to how your body feels and allows you to make food choices for yourself
without judgement.
Mindfulness takes time and dedication to master. Aim to eating mindfully
as often as you can, and forgive yourself when you don’t. Being aware that
you don’t always have the time or energy to eat mindfully is part of building
a successful mindful eating practice. Trust yourself and your body's instincts
when it comes to food choices. It can take weeks, months, and sometimes
years for mindful or intuitive eating to become a natural part of your life. Be
patient with yourself, and enjoy the process of building a stronger mind-body
connection to support your relationship with food.

Tips for Eating Mindfully and Intuitively
• Prepare. Cooking for yourself is the best way to prepare your body to eat
mindfully. When you are preparing food, the sights and smells ignite the
part of your brain that readies your body to accept nourishment. If you are
eating at a restaurant, enjoy the sounds, smells, and sights as you wait for
your food.
• Put away electronics. Allow yourself to hold space for one thing: eating.
Make sure all electronics are away from your eating space and eyesight.
• Sit down. Take a deep breath, center yourself, and give yourself permission
to eat as much as you want and enjoy the food in front of you. If desired,
this would be the time to give thanks, pray, or say grace. Express gratitude
for all of the people who had a hand in growing and making your food,
including yourself.
• Develop a mealtime ritual. This may include setting the table, or turning
on some relaxing music to enjoy during the meal.
• Be still. Dedicate at least part of the meal to silent enjoyment of the food.
• Connect. When eating alone, connect to your mind and body. Notice how
the food tastes when you chew slowly and savor it. Pay attention to your
body’s reaction. When eating a meal with family or friends, connect with
them over the meal. Talk about the food together.
• Take in the food with all of your senses. What does the food look like?
What do you hear? Is the food sizzling? What does the food smell like?
Are there smells other than the food? How does the food feel in your
hands or in your mouth? What’s the texture like? How does the food taste?
Is it savory, or sweet? Taste everything and chew slowly. Try to identify
ingredients and flavors. This activity can be helpful for anyone looking
to heal their relationship to food. It can be an especially fun activity with
children to help them understand and appreciate what they are eating.
• Listen to your body. Recognize when you have had enough to eat, or when
you want more. Honor those internal cues as natural and healthy. A major
sign of fullness is that food becomes less appetizing, or doesn’t taste as
good as it did when you began the meal. People with eating disorders
and diabetes, or those who eat lots of sugar and processed foods may
find it difficult to notice hunger and fullness. If you find yourself eating
uncontrollably, you may need to limit the amount of food you put on your
plate at first. Waiting five minutes before getting seconds can also help your
body become more aware of hunger and fullness cues.
