Vitamin E is an antioxidant which also supports the immune system, protects the
lining of blood vessels, and positively influences several metabolic processes in
the body.'? Nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, and leafy greens contain vitamin E. Some
food products contain vitamin E as a preservative and it can also be consumed via

increase the risk of bleeding. Talk to your functional medicine practitioner about
