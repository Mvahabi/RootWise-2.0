Most people should have a small amount of protein with every meal and snack
to help regulate blood sugar and promote satiety. The benefits of protein
come from amino acids, the building blocks of protein.

There are nine essential amino acids, which can be obtained from plant or
animal protein.1,2 Below are guidelines for choosing both types of protein. For
personalized protein recommendations, talk to a functional medicine clinician.

Lean and Clean
When choosing proteins, “lean” and “clean” are two guiding principles to
follow. The lean principle means selecting proteins with little-to-no saturated
fat, such as beans or skinless chicken breasts. Choosing lean proteins is
important for individuals who need to limit their fat intake because of high
cholesterol or heart disease.

In following the clean principle, it is strongly advised to purchase organic,
non-GMO (non-genetically modified) products for all protein sources to avoid
herbicides, pesticides, and other chemicals. Reducing exposure to these
chemicals is important for many aspects of health.
