Calcium is a mineral that is theprimary component ofbones and teeth.
Calcium also participates in communication between cells, aids muscle
function, supports blood clotting, and helps regulate heart rhythm.12 The
body works very hard to keep a steady calcium level in the blood, even if
that means harming bone health.

body works very hard to keep a steady calcium level in the blood, even if
that means harming bone health.
When there is not enough calcium in the diet, the body takes this mineral from the
bones to maintain a steady blood level and support other critical functions in the
body. Over time, calcium depletion in the bones can result in low bone density,
called osteopenia. Osteopenia can progress to osteoporosis, which increases the
risk of bone fractures.
Calcium is widely available from foods and supplements. Both calcium content
and bioavailability should be considered when selecting food and supplemental
sources of calcium. Beyond dairy sources, a variety of other foods, including
certain vegetables, legumes, seeds, and soy products like tofu, can help you meet
your calcium needs when consistently included in the diet. Talk to your functional
medicine provider about calcium supplementation, as there are complementary
nutrients (including vitamin D, vitamin K, and magnesium) that also support bone
health and overall health.?
