Folate helps the body produce and maintain new cells. This is especially important
during rapid growth and cell division, such as infancy and pregnancy." Folate is
needed to make new DNA and helps prevent damage to DNA that may lead to
cancer. Adults and children need folate to make normal red blood cells and prevent
anemia. Folate is also essential for the metabolism of homocysteine, an amino acid
that in high amounts may contribute to heart disease, dementia, and depression.'2

The RDAs for folate are expressed as dietary folate equivalents (DFEs) to reflect
a higher bioavailability of folic acid compared to natural folate from food.2 Some
individuals, like those with genetic variants in MTHFR, may respond better to
natural folate than folic acid.1 Talk to your functional medicine practitioner if you
have questions or concerns about your folate intake.
