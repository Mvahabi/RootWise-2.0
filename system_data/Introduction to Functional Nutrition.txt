Introduction to
Functional Nutrition
Functional nutrition is aboutfinding the right wayfor each ofus to eat—
usingfood to maximize thepotential for health and reverse dysfunction or
disease. There is no single “right diet” that applies to everyone. We have
different genetic backgrounds, different preferences, and different lives. We
all want to be healthy, butmany ofus haven'tfigured out exactly how to
makefood and dietary patterns serve that goal. Functional nutrition offers
the concepts, strategies, and tools to make that happen.

Functional Nutrition Fundamentals
For untold centuries, humans have relied on the food supply as a source
of energy, health, and connection. However, over the last several decades,
changes in the food supply (and in how we use it) have contributed strongly to
the growing epidemic of chronic disease. Functional nutrition developed out
of a desire on the part of healthcare providers to change that picture.
Emerging science is very clear that food is a powerful influence on health.
Food offers not only the calories that fuel our body's metabolism (engine), but
it also contains many diverse components that play important roles in all our
bodily functions. Poor-quality food can create disease, and high-quality food
(in the right proportions and amounts) can reverse disease and sustain health.
In a very real sense, food is medicine!

There are three basic elements in foods:
• Macronutrients: the proteins, fats, and carbohydrates that are the building
blocks of all food

The abundance of processed foods has negatively impacted our nutrition and
health. Food manufacturing practices like stripping whole grains of their fiber,
adding sweeteners and excessive salt to foods, and applying toxic chemicals
to agriculture can have a negative impact on our health. When processed
foods are eaten regularly, they can make us sick.

Functional Nutrition Fundamentals

Food is information, not just energy or calories. Food tells our bodies how to
function by signaling when and how each type of cell should behave in every
situation. So, we want the very best information to reach our cells to help
achieve optimal functioning.
Food also represents connection. Food connects us when we prepare and eat
together and enjoy celebrations or ceremonies, affirming cultural bonds.
How Does Functional Nutrition Work?
Functional nutrition emphasizes healthful eating personalized to your
genetics, lifestyle, environment, and health concerns. Functional nutrition
offers strategies and tools to improve your health, including recipes, cooking,
and food storage recommendations, plus steps to achieve mindful eating.
When you work with a functional nutrition practitioner to help you understand
and implement your personalized food plan, you will have access to a wealth
of information to help you adopt a new approach to food and nutrition. Your
provider will also determine if other interventions are needed.
Changing eating behaviors isn’t easy, even if you are well-informed about
what to do. There will be ups and downs. But, unlike a diet, these changes
are not harsh restrictions on your eating, and they do not involve counting
calories or depriving yourself of delicious food. They are scientifically sound
approaches that can benefit you for a lifetime! Just start with the following
basic concepts: eat fresh, eat color, eat texture, and (from bestselling author
Michael Pollan) eat real food, not too much, mostly plants.
Welcome to functional nutrition. It is the best way to harness the energy,
information, and connections of food to create health and reverse disease!
