When you are trying to improve your diet and limit how much sugar you eat,
knowing the best options can be a challenge. The lists here describe various
types of natural sweeteners and the pros and cons of each category. There
are three categories of natural sweeteners: natural caloric sweeteners, non-
caloric sugar alternatives, and sugar alcohols. While natural sweeteners
have some advantages in comparison to refined sugars (such as corn syrup
or table sugar), it is recommended to limit all sweeteners for optimal health.

¢ Coconut sugar: This type of sugar is made from the sap of coconut palm
trees, and it tastes similar to brown sugar. Coconut sugar contains small
amounts of minerals, antioxidants, and fiber.

e Dates: Dates are considered one of the world’s oldest fruits. They contain
fiber, along with small amounts of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
While dates contain sugar, most varieties do not raise blood sugar as high as
table sugar. Some research suggests dates may improve cholesterol because
of their phytonutrient content. Because they are a whole fruit, dates are not
included in the added sugars total of a food package’s label.

Natural Caloric Sweeteners
Natural Caloric Sweeteners
These sweeteners contain calories and sugar, so they raise your body’s blood
sugar and can cause dental cavities. Most are included in the “added sugars”
total on a food’s Nutrition Facts label. For more information about added
sugars and label reading, see IFM’s Overview of Sweeteners document.
For optimal health, caloric sweeteners should be significantly limited. The
following options are best due to their modest benefits:

Natural Sugar Alternatives
These sweeteners do not contain sugar and are virtually calorie-free, so they
are not included in the sugar total of a food package’s Nutrition Facts label.
To find out if a food contains these sweeteners, check the ingredients list of
the package.
In general, these are good options for supporting healthy blood sugar balance
and avoiding added sugars:
• Stevia leaf: Stevia comes from a plant grown in South America (Stevia
rebaudiana), and it tastes much sweeter than table sugar. There is some
evidence to suggest that pure stevia may be helpful for blood sugar
management. There are commercial sweeteners that are partially made with
stevia, but they also contain additives that may cause adverse reactions.
Because of this, 100% pure stevia extract or stevia leaf is best.
• Allulose: Allulose is referred to as a “rare sugar” because it is naturally
found in only a few fruits, and it does not raise blood sugar or provide
calories. It tastes slightly less sweet than table sugar. There is some
evidence to suggest that allulose may be a good sweetener for blood sugar
and weight management, but it may cause digestive symptoms if eaten in
large amounts. It is recommended to gradually increase your intake of this
sweetener to prevent unwanted digestive symptoms.
• Tagatose: Tagatose is another “rare sugar” found naturally in only a few
foods, and it has a chemical structure similar to fruit sugar (fructose). It
tastes about as sweet as table sugar, but it does not raise blood sugar.
Research has shown tagatose may be helpful for blood sugar management,
oral health, and the gut microbiome. This sweetener may cause digestive
symptoms when eaten in large amounts, so it is recommended to gradually
increase your intake of this sweetener.
• Monk fruit (luo han guo) extract: Monk fruit (Siraitia grosvenorii) is a small
round fruit that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds
of years. The extract of pure monk fruit juice tastes much sweeter than table
sugar, though it does not raise blood sugar. This sweetener is new to the
U.S. market and research around its potential benefits is still limited, but it
may be a promising sugar alternative.
Tip: To quickly find sugar
alcohols in an ingredients list,
look for ingredient names
ending in “-ol” as in xylitol.
Sugar Alcohols
Sugar alcohols (such as xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, and erythritol) are derived
from some fruits and vegetables, but they can also be manufactured. They are
often added to chewing gum, mouthwash, toothpaste, and processed foods.
These sweeteners have fewer calories than caloric sweeteners, and they taste
slightly less sweet than table sugar.
Sugar alcohols have two advantages: they do not cause dental cavities, and
they do not raise blood sugar as much as the caloric sweeteners. Most sugar
alcohols should be avoided if you have digestive conditions (such as bacterial
overgrowth, yeast overgrowth, or irritable bowel syndrome), as they can

cause diarrhea, gas, and bloating. One possible exception is erythritol, as it is
considered the best-tolerated sugar alcohol.
You may see sugar alcohols listed in the carbohydrates section of a food
package’s Nutrition Facts label; however, food manufacturers are not always
required to list them there. It is best to check the ingredients list of a food to
determine if sugar alcohols are included.
