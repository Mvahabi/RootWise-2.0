Selenium is an essential trace mineral important for thyroid health, DNA
production, reproductive health, immune support, and antioxidant defense.
The nutrient is found in both animal and plant-based foods.
Selenium is present in seafood, meats, eggs, some dairy products, grains,
nuts, seeds, and other plant foods. Plant sources of the mineral may have
variable selenium content, as their uptake of this nutrient depends on the
selenium concentration of the soil where they are grown.
