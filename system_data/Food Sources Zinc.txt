Zinc is an essential trace mineral; it must be obtained through the diet and
is required by the body in small amounts. Zinc is found in shellfish, beefand
other red meats, as well as nuts, legumes andfortified breakfast cereals.
The bioavailability ofzinc, or the amount retained and used by the body,
maybe lower in grains andplant proteins because thesefoods also contain
phytates, which bind to zinc and inhibit its absorption.

Zinc plays an important role in several body systems — over 100 enzymes in
the body require zinc to function. Zinc is necessary for normal growth and
development, immune and neurological function, proper sense oftaste and smell,
and maintaining the structure of cell membranes, as well as protecting them from
oxidative damage. maintenance, influences cell growth and development, and is
required for proper immune function.
