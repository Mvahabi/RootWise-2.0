Prebiotic Foods
The digestive tract is home to more than 500 species ofbacteria, comprising
about 100 trillion “bugs” altogether. Collectively, they are tremendously
importantfor overall health. Wegive these bugs a home; in exchange, they
do a variety ofthings for us. For instance, they help digestfood, make certain
vitamins, andplay an important role in immune defense. These bugs also act
as a barrier to help our bodies filter and appropriately absorb nutrients from
what we eat.

Probiotics & Prebiotics
There are “good” bugs called probiotics, which we can constantly replenish.
They need nourishing food to help them grow. Prebiotics are the fiber-rich
foods that probiotics feed and grow on. As a bonus, a compound called
butyric acid is produced when the probiotics break down prebiotics in the
colon. Butyric acid is the preferred form of fuel for the cells that line the colon.
It also acidifies the gut, making it harder for harmful bacteria to survive.
Two of the main probiotic bacteria that reside in the digestive tract are
Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. These can be taken in the form of supplements
or included in the diet in the form of fermented (or probiotic) foods.

colony-forming units (CFUs) daily. To put these guidelines into perspective,
most store-bought probiotic yogurts contain about 1 billion CFUs per serving.
To get the maximum benefit from fermented foods, it’s important to read
product labels and choose only those that contain “active, live cultures” and
preferably raw, unpasteurized, perishable ingredients. Organic brands are
the best choices, as they are not typically heat-treated after fermentation, so
more of the good bacteria are present.
Fermented foods can also be made at home. Though the probiotic content
will vary by batch, home fermenting is a safe way to ensure that you are
ingesting beneficial bacteria, as various cultures around the world have done
for centuries.
