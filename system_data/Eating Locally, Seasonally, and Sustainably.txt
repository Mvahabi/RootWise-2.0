Eating Locally, Seasonally,
and Sustainably

Growing food yourself generally costs the least. If you don’t have garden space,
check if there’s a community garden where you can grow food. In some areas, you
may be able to pick fruit from trees that grow on public land.
Support Your Local Economy and the Environment
Making local, sustainable food choices supports farmers in your community and
puts money back into your local economy. Besides shopping at farmers markets,
you can also check for farm shops, pick-your-own farms, roadside stands, mobile
markets (refrigerated trucks), and urban rooftop farms.

Another way to support local growers is to participate in Community Supported
Agriculture (CSA). This allows consumers and farmers to share the risks and
benefits of growing food.

Though CSAs look differently worldwide, members (shareholders) generally:
• Pay a fee to help meet a farm’s operating expenses, such as in one lump sum
at the start of the growing season or in installments. Farmers may offer CSA
shares at a discount (called cost-offset CSAs) to those with limited income.
• Receive a portion of the farm’s produce each week during the growing season.
Some farms may also offer items like honey, eggs, and milk. In some cases, you
pick up the food at the farm. Other farms may have pick-up sites in cities.
• Get to know the farmers and how food is grown. Many farms host field days,
publish newsletters, share recipes, and offer educational classes.
The CSA model of farming is growing across the globe. It encourages more
eco-friendly farming practices. It can also help minimize food waste by basing
production on the number of members.
Your choice of these and other healthy, sustainable food strategies will vary based
on where you live, your dietary needs, and other factors. Check what is available
in your area and choose what works for you.

Health Benefits of Eating Locally and Seasonally
Some ways that buying local and seasonal produce can support your health and
enjoyment of food include:
¢ Higher nutritional value: The less distance that plant foods travel to reach you
and the less time they sit in stores, the more likely they are to retain their quality
and nutrient levels. For example, one study found that, on average, mixed salad
greens refrigerated for 10 days lost 59% of their vitamin C.

¢ Greater phytonutrient diversity: When you expand outside your usual
food choices and eat a variety of local and seasonal produce, you will take
in a broader array of healthful phytonutrients. Ask your functional medicine
practitioner about IFM’s Phytonutrient Spectrum documents to learn more.

¢ More flavor: In-season produce is typically more flavorful than out-of-season
food. So, choosing seasonal food can make eating healthily easier. For example,
imagine the taste and color of a fresh summer tomato and compare it with one
purchased in the winter. No contest: the summer tomato is far better.

Eating Seasonally and Locally Could Save You Money
Eating Seasonally andLocally Could Save You Money
Out-of-season fruits and vegetables often come with a higher price tag due to the
transportation and storage costs of foods shipped from far away. Prices also tend
to go up when there is a limited supply.
In contrast, food that is in season is usually in high supply. That means grocery
stores have a relatively short time to sell a lot of produce before it spoils. So, you
can often find in-season foods on sale or reasonably priced at stores.
Buying directly from farmers has grown in popularity in areas such as North
America and Europe. This approach may save you money compared to shopping
in stores, but prices vary based on the item and where you live. In one U.S. study,
cucumbers cost 24% less at the farmers market than at the grocery store, but
farmers-market strawberries cost more than twice as much as store-bought.
Comparison shop at the farmers market, as different vendors’ prices often vary
for the same item. Ask about growers’ farming practices, which can affect prices.
Some vendors work with food assistance programs to help low-income shoppers.
