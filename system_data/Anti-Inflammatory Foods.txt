Anti-Inflammatory
Foods
Ongoing, low-grade inflammation underlies many common health problems.
These include heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, digestive
issues, arthritis, and various brain disorders. Among the top causes of
chronic inflammation are unhealthy eating, physical inactivity, and obesity
(especially belly fat). Chronic infections, unbalanced gut bacteria, and toxin
exposure also promote inflammation. A healthy lifestyle, including nutritious
eating habits, helps tame inflammation.

Whole foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds
are rich in inflammation-fighting compounds. These include many vitamins,
minerals, phytonutrients (plant compounds), and fiber. Omega-3 fats and
probiotics (good bacteria), found in some animal and plant foods, can also
calm inflammation.

The nutritional components of foods work in different ways to control
inflammation. Some prevent the body from making as many inflammatory
molecules. Others work as antioxidants to protect cells against damage from
inflammation. Some promote a healthy community of gut bacteria, which can
also help combat inflammation.

The following sections highlight foods with anti-inflammatory benefits, as
shown in research studies. Similar foods in these categories could also have
anti-inflammatory benefits but may be less well-studied.

Vegetables
Vegetables offer fiber and antioxidants, including beta-carotene, which
gives an orange color. Vegetables are also super sources of green and red
phytonutrients that fight inflammation. Some of the top anti-inflammatory
vegetables are:
• Dark green leafy vegetables: lettuce (such as romaine and green leaf),
spinach, Swiss chard

Fruits
Fruits provide fiber and antioxidants, including vitamin C. Many fruits are also
rich in phytonutrients that reduce inflammation. Purple, red, and other bright
colors are clues that fruits are high in phytonutrients. Enjoy these options:
• Berries: blackberries, blueberries, cranberries, raspberries, strawberries
• Citrus fruits: oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes
• Other fruits: apples (with peel), cherries, grapes, pomegranates
Whole Grains
The fiber and phytonutrients in whole grains promote healthy gut bacteria
that make anti-inflammatory byproducts. Whole grains are also good sources
of selenium and zinc, which are two minerals with antioxidant properties.
Consider these whole grain choices:
• Gluten-free grains: brown rice, pigmented rice (red, purple, or black),
buckwheat, gluten-free oats, millet
• Gluten-containing grains: barley, rye, whole wheat, including spelt and
Kamut® (if you are not gluten-sensitive)
Legumes
Legumes are rich in plant protein and phytonutrients with antioxidant and
anti-inflammatory properties. Legumes are also super sources of fiber to
promote healthy gut bacteria. Enjoy whole and minimally-processed legumes,
including:
• Soy foods: edamame, soy milk, soy nuts, tofu (buy organic/non-GMO)*
• Other legumes: beans (such as black, garbanzo, kidney), lentils, peas
*GMO means genetically-modified organisms.
Nuts and Seeds
Nuts and seeds offer various nutrients linked with anti-inflammatory benefits,
including B vitamins, vitamin E, magnesium, selenium, and zinc. These
crunchy treats also provide anti-inflammatory phytonutrients, healthy fats,
and fiber. Here are some of the best anti-inflammatory options:
• Nuts: almonds, Brazil nuts, pistachios, walnuts, mixed nuts
• Seeds: chia seeds, flaxseeds (ground or flaxseed meal), hemp seeds,
pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds
Healthy Fats
Monounsaturated fats, omega-3s, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) are
anti-inflammatory fats in some plant-based oils and animal products. Plus,

plant-based oils offer phytonutrients and vitamin E to fend off inflammation.
Try these top sources of anti-inflammatory fats:
• Oily fish: wild-caught salmon, anchovies, halibut, herring, sardines, trout
• Olive products: olives and olive oil, especially extra-virgin olive oil
• Other: avocados, omega-3 enriched eggs, grass-fed animal products
Fermented Foods*
During fermentation, some microbes release anti-inflammatory compounds.
Plus, eating fermented foods containing live probiotics promotes healthy
gut bacteria, which also make anti-inflammatory agents (such as CLA). Some
anti-inflammatory fermented foods tested in studies include:
• Fermented dairy products: kefir, yogurt
• Plant-based ferments: sauerkraut, kimchi (fermented cabbage and other
vegetables), tempeh (fermented soybeans formed in a block)
• Fermented beverages: kombucha (fermented black or green tea)
*If you are histamine-intolerant, fermented foods may trigger symptoms.
Herbs, Spices & Tea
Many herbs, spices, and teas are rich in phytonutrients that can help calm
inflammation. Use them often to boost your intake of their healthy plant
compounds. Here are some options shown to have anti-inflammatory benefits:
• Herbs and spices: cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, saffron, thyme, turmeric
• Tea: black tea, cistus tea, green tea, yerba mate tea
