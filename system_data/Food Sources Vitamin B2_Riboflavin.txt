Vitamin B2, commonly referred to as riboflavin, is a water-soluble essential
nutrient. It is necessary for two important enzymes in the body, which are
required for energy production and a wide variety of functions within cells.
Riboflavin helps maintain healthy levels of homocysteine, an amino acid that in high
levels can contribute to heart and other diseases." Milk, liver, almonds, and spinach
are good sources of vitamin B2.? Exposure to light can deactivate riboflavin, which is
