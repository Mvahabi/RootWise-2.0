To identify patients who are at risk for food insecurity, ask the following
questions:
Preface these questions with “I ask all of my patients about access to food.
There are many community resources available often free of charge for
individuals. For each statement, please tell me if it was often true, sometimes
true, or never true.”

¢ Within the past 12 months I/we were worried whether our food would run
out before we got money to buy more.
¢ Within the past 12 months the food I/we bought just didn’t last, and I/we
didn't have the money to get more.
• Within the past 12 months I/we were worried whether our food would run
out before we got money to buy more.
• Within the past 12 months the food I/we bought just didn’t last, and I/we
didn’t have the money to get more.
“Often true” or “sometimes true” to any statement indicates the patient is
at risk for food/nutrition insecurity. If a patient is at risk for food insecurity,
provide the Food Resources handout available in the IFM toolkit.

Additional Ways to Support Patients:
• Refer patients experiencing food insecurity to skilled outreach workers,
like social workers, to make sure they receive the resources they need.
• Become familiar with the food banks in your area and the services they
offer. Food banks offer a variety of services including fresh produce from
community gardens, programs specifically designed for seniors, budget-
friendly cooking demos, and nutrition workshops. Share this information
with your patients on your website and/or in educational materials.
• If you work in a clinic setting, offer a “food shelf” (a collection of non-
perishable food staples stored on-site) to patients, or partner with a food
bank to provide groceries to patients periodically.
• Many medical centers and hospitals offer patients a “food pharmacy”
where patients can receive healthy meals. Check if this service is available
locally or advocate for this service at your workplace.
