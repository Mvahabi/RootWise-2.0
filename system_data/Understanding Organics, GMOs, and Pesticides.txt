Organics, GMOs,

Part ofa healthy lifestyle includes eatingfresh, high-quality, minimally
processed foods. When you begin to incorporate these foods into your diet,
it can be hard to navigate the healthy claims made about organic foods,
genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), andpesticides. What does it all

Organic vs Conventional Foods
Organic foods are foods that are grown without the use of genetic
engineering or synthetic (or man-made) fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides,
irradiation, sewage sludge, hormones, and antibiotics. In order to be certified
“organic” by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), organic
farms are strictly prohibited from using these technologies and chemicals.
In general, organic farms must demonstrate that they are protecting natural
resources and conserving biodiversity as part of their operations.
Foods that don't meet the USDA's strict requirements for the USDA organic
label — but still meet the standard requirements for food production—are
referred to as conventional foods. The technologies and chemicals prohibited
on organic farms are legal on conventional farms, and they make the farming
process much less expensive. Because of this, conventional foods often cost
much less than organic foods.

Conventionally-farmed foods are cheaper in the short-run, but they can
contain hormones, antibiotics, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides — all of
which have associated health risks. Conventionally-farmed foods may also
have lower concentrations of nutrients than organic foods, depending on how
and where crops are planted each growing season.

What About “All Natural” Foods?
Foods and food products advertised as “all natural” contain no artificial
colors, flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, or other additives. The ingredients
in “all natural” foods may be conventionally or organically farmed.

genetic engineering. Plants have historically been genetically engineered
to select for desirable traits like size, growth speed, sweetness, weather
resistance, bug resistance, and so on. Most of the GMOs grown today
have been engineered to resist herbicides, which are chemicals used to kill
weeds. The result of genetic engineering and the heavy use of pesticides like
herbicide have created herbicide-resistant “super weeds” and “super bugs”,
which can only be killed with more toxic poisons.
GMO crops require fewer chemicals and less time, machinery, and land than
organic crops, but changing the DNA of an organism could have side effects
that are impossible to control or predict. This relatively new science creates
unstable combinations of plant, animal, bacterial and viral genes that do not
occur in nature or through traditional crossbreeding methods. GMOs also
pose a significant allergy risk. By splicing together unstable combinations of
genes, we could create new allergens in foods that haven’t caused allergies in
people before. There’s also the risk that foods with built-in antibiotic qualities
could make antibiotics less effective on humans.
The bottom line is that there is not yet enough evidence to know what effect
GMOs will have on us, or on the earth. Most developed nations do not
consider GMOs to be safe, and have banned or restricted the production
and sale of GMOs in their food supplies. However, the U.S. and Canadian
governments have approved GMOs based on scientific studies, which have
been funded or conducted by the corporations that create GMOs and profit
from their sale.
The best bet is to limit GMOs in your diet until there is enough evidence-
based research supporting their safety. At this stage, GMOs are not required
to be labeled in the food supply, but many companies are labeling their food
products that are verified as GMO-free.
The Danger of Pesticides
Pesticides are chemicals that are meant to kill pests, including weeds,
microbes, fungi, insects, rodents, etc. Most pesticides protect plants during
the growing season, but the potential health risks they pose far outweigh their
benefits.
For all pesticides to be effective against the pests they are intended
to control, they must be biologically active, or toxic. Pesticides used in
conventional farming are made from fossil fuels. They are sprayed on produce
to prevent destruction, but their chemical residue stays on the food. This food
is then sold as fresh produce, or fed to livestock that become the meat we
eat. Pesticides used in organic farming are made from natural substances and
are less harmful to the environment.
Pesticides are meant to kill pests, but they end up harming other beneficial
forms of life, like wildlife and bees. In humans, prolonged exposure to
pesticides is known or suspected to cause birth defects, toxicity to a fetus,
benign or malignant tumors, genetic changes, blood disorders, nerve
disorders, endocrine disruption, and reproductive challenges.

Organic foods have less pesticide residue than conventional foods. If you
want to limit your exposure to pesticides, begin by buying organic foods
whenever possible. Washing your foods before eating or cooking will also
help reduce your exposure.
Shopping for Organic, Non-GMO Foods
Grocery shopping can be a challenge when you’re trying to avoid GMOs
