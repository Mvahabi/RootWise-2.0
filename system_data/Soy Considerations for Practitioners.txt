Soy Considerations
(for Practitioners)
Soybeans have a unique macronutrient composition compared to other
legumes and are one of the few vegetarian protein sources that contain all
essential amino acids required in the human diet, making them a complete
protein. These qualities make soy a healthy addition or alternative to animal
protein in the diet.1

protein in the diet.1
Soy is generally consumed in two main forms: foods and supplements.
Common food sources include edamame, tofu, soy milk, soy flour, tempeh,
miso, and soy sauce. Supplements generally contain refined soy components
in the form of isolated soy protein and soy-derived isoflavones, including
genistein, daidzein, and glycitein."

Soy Research
Soy Research
Studies of soy mainly focus on three sources:
¢ Dietary whole soy protein intake (e.g., soybeans, tofu)
¢ Isolated soy protein supplements
¢ Dietary supplementation with soy isoflavones
Studies of soy mainly focus on three sources:
• Dietary whole soy protein intake (e.g., soybeans, tofu)
• Isolated soy protein supplements
• Dietary supplementation with soy isoflavones
The form of soy makes a difference when considering the benefits and risks.?
There are mixed results within published studies regarding the benefits or
risks of soy and its components due to variability in study design (animal
vs. human, in vitro vs. in vivo, etc.), the soy administered (type, amount
consumed, bioavailability, etc.), as well as differences in study population
(ethnicity, hormonal status, age, sex, and overall health of study participants).°

The isoflavones found in soy have been studied extensively and have shown
mixed but often positive results. Recent studies have focused on S-equol, or
equol, which is a breakdown product of daidzein. Daidzein is converted into
equol mainly in the large intestine by a variety of bacteria. Therefore, the
microbiome can influence whether or not someone is an “equol producer.”

Notable benefits from soy can be found throughout the body, including for
general health, cardiovascular health, women’s health, men’s health, cognition,
and cancer risk. The long list of benefits has established soy as a powerhouse
food. As with some foods, certain populations require special consideration
for soy usage, which will be addressed later in this document.
General Health
Soy has all nine essential amino acids, so it is a complete protein. Also, the
macronutrient breakdown for soy compared to other legumes is lower in
carbohydrates and higher in protein, unsaturated fat, and dietary fiber.1
A ¼-cup serving of firm tofu provides 14 grams of protein, 2.2 grams of
carbohydrates, and 1.9 grams of fiber. Soy is also rich in vitamins and minerals,
including B vitamins, magnesium, calcium, and potassium.2
Cardiovascular Health
Soy is well-known for supporting heart health. A ¼-cup serving of firm tofu
supplies 7 grams of fat, most of which are heart-healthy polyunsaturated and
monounsaturated fatty acids. Studies have shown that replacing higher animal
fat proteins with soy protein may lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.2
In addition, diets that incorporate soy protein may modestly reduce blood
pressure in those with elevated blood pressure.5
S-equol, a by-product of soy metabolism in certain individuals, may be anti-
atherogenic, improve arterial stiffness, and help prevent heart disease.6
Higher intake of isoflavones and tofu is associated with a moderately lower
risk of coronary heart disease. There is an inverse association between tofu
intake and heart disease risk, primarily in premenopausal women and in
postmenopausal women not using hormone replacement therapy.7,8
Women’s Health
Soy can positively influence women’s health through several different
mechanisms and throughout their lifespan. Dietary soy, soy isoflavone
supplements, and S-equol supplements may help reduce the frequency and
severity of menopausal hot flashes.7,9 Soy isoflavones may be beneficial for
bone health by preventing bone loss, especially in the lumbar spine, and
increasing bone formation and density during early menopause.7,10,11
Men’s Health
Dietary intake of soy and soy isoflavones has been shown to reduce the risk
of prostate cancer. This might be due to increased activation of estrogen
receptor beta, which has been linked to decreased prostate cancer cell
proliferation and reduced histological grade.12 A recent meta-analysis of
clinical studies indicates that soy consumption does not have a negative
impact on testosterone or other androgens in men.13

Cognition
Healthy aging and brain health are other areas where soy may provide
benefits. Soy isoflavones, as well as S-equol, may help with cognitive function
and should be considered part of the dietary interventions for cognitive
decline and dementia.6,14,15 Soy’s positive influence on cardiovascular health
also supports cognitive health since heart disease and the risk of dementia
and Alzheimer’s disease are closely connected.
Cancer
High dietary intake of soy foods or soy isoflavones may reduce the risk
of breast and colorectal cancers, as well as the reoccurrence of breast
cancer.7 Regular consumption of soy isoflavones and soy products has been
associated with a reduced risk of endometrial and bladder cancer.7
Soy isoflavones may help increase the efficacy of chemotherapy and
radiation, especially in prostate cancer, as well as protect normal cells from
some of the negative effects of radiation and anti-cancer drugs.16
Special Considerations: Soy Tolerance & Safety
Food sensitivities and allergies to soy are common. There are eight proteins
in soy that can trigger an allergic response. Due to soy’s allergenic potential,
foods containing soy proteins must include an allergen warning separate
from the ingredient list. Different forms of processing, like fermentation, may
reduce soybean sensitivity or allergenicity.17
Soy products are typically removed during an elimination diet. Soy may
cause digestive upset (constipation, diarrhea, nausea, bloating) in those
who are sensitive. This may be due to the levels of phytic acid, lignans, and
oligosaccharides, which may be harder for some people to digest.10,18
Tip: Choose organic soy
products to avoid exposure
to genetically-modified soy
treated with glyphosate.
In addition, most conventional soy on the market is genetically modified,
termed glyphosate-tolerant, for use with glyphosate herbicide. Genetically
modified soy and soy products contain high residues of glyphosate, which
makes its way into the food chain, where it can have harmful effects on the
body.19 Choose organic soy as much as possible to help avoid exposure.
Special Considerations: Soy & Health Conditions
Those with breast cancer may want to avoid isoflavone supplements and
limit dietary intake of isoflavones from soy foods to 3 servings per day.19
Consuming soy in amounts greater than what is commonly found in foods
during pregnancy may be unsafe for the baby due to the potential estrogenic
activity of soy. It is also unknown if consuming greater amounts of soy or soy
isoflavones while breastfeeding is safe for infants.18
High soy intake may alter thyroid function in high-risk groups. The
mechanism is not entirely clear, but it may be due, in part, to soy having

some goitrogenic properties. Those with iodine insufficiency or deficiency
(especially during pregnancy) or those with hypothyroidism may want to avoid
isoflavone supplements and limit dietary intake of soy foods to 3 servings per
day.19 Ensuring adequate iodine levels will reduce adverse thyroid effects from
soy intake in most cases.
Administration of levothyroxine medication concurrently with dietary soy
protein or soy protein supplements results in decreased absorption of
levothyroxine and the need for higher oral doses of levothyroxine to attain
therapeutic serum thyroid hormone levels. Separating the time of soy intake
from the dosing of levothyroxine as indicated in dosing instructions appears
to mitigate this interaction.20
Infants with congenital hypothyroidism who are fed soy formula have a
prolonged increase of TSH when compared to infants fed non-soy formula.
Close monitoring of thyroxine and TSH levels is warranted, and an increased
dose of thyroxine may be necessary to achieve normal thyroid function.21
