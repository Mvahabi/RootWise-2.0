Sodium is an essential electrolyte that helps control the amount offluid in
the body. It also helps regulate blood pressure and the absorption ofother
nutrients (such as chloride, amino acids, andglucose).! Sodium is typically
consumed as salt, which is a combination ofthe minerals sodium and
chloride.

Food Sources:
Common sources of sodium include table salt, sea salt, processed foods, and
restaurant foods. Additives such as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrate
or sodium nitrite, disodium phosphate, sodium citrate, baking powder, and baking
soda also contain sodium. Unprocessed vegetables, fruits, and whole grains contain
very little sodium.

Too much sodium in the diet is a major contributor to high blood pressure,
which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.? Current dietary guidelines
recommend no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium (about 1 teaspoon of
salt) from all foods and beverages daily.? For individuals with high blood pressure,
it is recommended to limit sodium intake to 1,500 mg daily.

Sodium Labeling
Sodium Labeling
Food labels list the amount of sodium per serving. This information can help you
compare products and choose those lower in sodium. The following label terms may
also be helpful:
- Sodium-free or salt-free: Each serving contains less than 5 mg of sodium
- Very low sodium: Each serving contains 35 mg of sodium or less
⋅ Sodium-free or salt-free: Each serving contains less than 5 mg of sodium
⋅ Very low sodium: Each serving contains 35 mg of sodium or less

Food labels list the amount of sodium per serving. This information can help you
compare products and choose those lower in sodium. The following label terms may
also be helpful:

⋅ Low sodium: Each serving contains 140 mg of sodium or less
⋅ Reduced or less sodium: The product contains at least 25 percent less sodium
than the regular version*
⋅ Lite or light in sodium: The sodium content has been reduced by at least 50
percent from the regular version*
⋅ Unsalted or no salt added: No salt was added during processing*
*Check the sodium per serving as the amount may still be relatively high in some
products.
Practical Tips
Your taste buds will adjust to less salt within a short period of time. Cooking at
home with basic ingredients, using more spices and herbs, avoiding or using only
very small amounts of high-sodium condiments, and tasting food before salting it
are good tips to follow when lowering sodium intake.
