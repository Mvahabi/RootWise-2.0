Vitamin AVitaminA
Vitamin A is the term used to describe a group offat-soluble compounds
which are available in the diet in two differentforms: preformed vitamin A
(retinol) andprovitamin A carotenoids, such as beta-carotene. The richest
sources ofpreformed vitamin A include organ meats andfish oils, with
smaller amounts found in dairy products andfortified cereals. Provitamin A
carotenoids arefound predominantly in orange, yellow, andgreen colored
fruits and vegetables.

Vitamin A is essential to support cell growth, immune function, and healthy vision.
Deficiency of vitamin A is a major, preventable cause of blindness, chronic infection,
low thyroid function, and disorders of the skin. Overconsumption of preformed
vitamin A is highly toxic, especially during pregnancy. Excess consumption of
carotenoids, however, is not associated with toxic side effects.

Preformed vitamin A is more easily absorbed and used by the body. Provitamin A
carotenoids must be converted to retinol. Food sources are ranked by micrograms
of retinol activity equivalents (mcg RAE) to reflect this difference in bioavailability.
