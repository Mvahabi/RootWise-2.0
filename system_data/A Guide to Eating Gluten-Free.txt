Gluten-Free Substitutes
Gluten-free alternatives to typical gluten-containing foods are now widely
available in most grocery stores. This makes eating a gluten-free diet less of a
hassle. But keep in mind that many products made with gluten-free alternatives
include additives and fillers that help mimic the texture of gluten-containing
products you’re used to eating. Rather than relying on gluten-free convenience
foods, it is important to base your diet around naturally gluten-free foods like
fruits, vegetables, and other foods listed above.
The following foods may contain hidden sources of gluten. Read labels carefully
when shopping, and ask restaurant staff to confirm that foods have not been
dusted with flour or cross-contaminated in deep fryers.
• Brown rice syrup
(made with barley enzymes)
• Candy, candy bars
• Cheesecake filling
• Eggs prepared in restaurants
(sometimes include pancake batter)
• Energy bars
• French fries
• Granola bars
• Marinades
• Meat substitutes (vegetarian
burgers, vegetarian sausage,
imitation bacon, imitation seafood,
etc.)
• Multi-grain or “artisan” tortillas and
tortilla chips
• Pizza, gluten-free (restaurants
offering gluten-free crusts do
not always keep gluten-free
items separate from the rest of
the kitchen)
• Potato chips
• Pre-seasoned meats
• Processed lunch meats
• Salad dressings
• Self-basting poultry
• Soup
• Soy sauce
• Starch or dextrin
(in meat or poultry products)
• Tater tots

Tips for Buying and Storing Gluten-Free Foods
• Read labels. Remember that “wheat-free” is not the same thing as “gluten-
free.” When in doubt, only purchase products with the certified gluten-free
label.
• Read ingredient lists for any processed or packaged foods you buy,
especially any foods that are cream-based. Wheat is often used in these
products as a thickener.
• Many personal care products and nutritional supplements contain gluten.
Be sure to choose brands that are gluten-free.
• Many gluten-free breads and pastas are stored in the refrigerated or frozen
sections in the grocery store.
• If you can’t find gluten-free grains or products in your regular grocery store,
try looking in a specialty or health food store.
• Do not purchase gluten-free grains from the bulk section of the grocery
store unless they are kept in a separate area from gluten-containing grains.
The possibility for cross-contamination with gluten is much higher when
gluten-containing and gluten-free grains are sold side by side.
• If not everyone in your household follows a gluten-free diet, store all gluten-
free products in a separate cabinet or a separate shelf. Keep gluten-free
foods on the top shelves away from gluten-containing foods on the lower
shelves. Use separate toasters and pans, if necessary. This will help you
avoid cross contamination.
• When purchasing beers, choose gluten-free brands that are made from
gluten-free grains. Some gluten-free beers are made from gluten-containing
grains that have been mechanically separated, and these beers may include
up to 10 parts per million (10 ppm) of gluten per bottle. If gluten-free beer
is not available, opt for cider, wine, or distilled spirits.
