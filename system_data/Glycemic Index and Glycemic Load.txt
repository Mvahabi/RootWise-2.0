Glycemic Load
Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is very importantfor your
overall health. Diabetes, prediabetes or insulin resistance, hypertension, heart
disease, and many other chronic conditions are caused orworsened bypoor
blood sugar control. Not allfoods have the same impact on blood sugar and
insulin. The Glycemic Index (GI) and Glycemic Load (GL) are two concepts that
can help you selectfoods for optimal blood sugar balance.

The Glycemic Index (Gl) is a way to measure the impact of a specific food on
blood sugar levels. The GI ranks carbohydrate-containing foods on a scale of
0 to 100 based on how quickly the foods raise blood sugar levels. The Gl is a
score of a food's impact on blood sugar based on laboratory studies when a
specific portion size was eaten.
The Glycemic Load (GL) is calculated by multiplying a food’s GI (as
a percentage) by the number of net grams of carbohydrates (total
carbohydrates minus fiber) in a meal or snack. The result is a score of how
much that serving of food is likely to increase blood sugar levels. GL takes into
account the GI score and the portion size someone is eating. Because of this,
GL is considered a more helpful measure compared to GI.

Generally speaking, eating appropriate portions of foods lower in both GI and
GL helps to stabilize blood sugar throughout the day. Foods are categorized
as low, medium, and high as shown in the table below.

Tips for Blood Sugar Balance:
⋅ While low-GL and low-GI foods are the best choices, most people will
also eat some medium-GL and medium-GI foods. One important tip to
remember is that medium- and high- GL foods should be eaten with
protein or fat, both of which soften the effect of these foods on your blood
sugar level.
⋅ GI refers to the increase in blood sugar for a defined portion of a specific
food. It does not take into account the actual portion of these foods eaten
in real life. For example, watermelon is considered to be high-GI, but the
average person eats a slice or two; therefore, the actual glycemic impact of
watermelon is low and not concerning.
⋅ There may be differences in how different individuals’ blood sugar responds
responds to low, medium, or high GI foods. For example, a relatively active
person who does not have diabetes may experience a small increase in
the blood sugar when a low GI food is eaten. In contrast, someone with
prediabetes may experience comparatively higher blood sugars with the
same low GI food. Checking your glucose levels regularly is the best way to
figure out how specific foods affect your blood sugar.
Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load in the IFM Food Plans
All foods in IFM’s Food Plans are low to medium GI and GL at the listed
serving sizes. Foods in the Protein, Nuts & Seeds, Fats & Oils, Non-Starchy
Vegetables, and Beverages, Spices, and Condiments categories have none
or a very small amount of carbohydrate. High-GI and-GL foods are not
recommended on a daily basis, as eating these frequently can result in blood
sugar imbalances. The table on the following page shows approximate serving
sizes for some of the most commonly recommended carbohydrate-containing
foods in IFM’s Food Plans.
