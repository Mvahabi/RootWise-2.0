At least some vitamin D needs are met through skin exposure to sunlight. How
much vitamin D is made depends on the time of day, age, how much skin is
uncovered, and skin tone. Without sunblock and with arms and legs exposed, the
skin will make an average of 10,000 to 15,000 units of vitamin D in one pinking
sun exposure. Sunblock with an SPF of more than 15 blocks 100% of vitamin D
production in the skin.
Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and regulates both calcium and
phosphorous levels in the blood. It plays an important role in bone growth and
maintenance, influences cell growth and development, and is required for proper
immune function.
